    My years of working in customer service have taught me so many valuable skills such as remaining calm under pressure, adapting quickly to unfamiliar environments and situations, and even simply looking for positives in any kind of scenario that occurs. These skills mixed with the mass array of computer skills I have learned at Kent State could lead to me becoming a great asset to any team. My completion of the Kent State Japanese Minor and my knowledge of Chinese and French could also be valuable tools in a situation where language skills are needed.

    <p>This club provides a casual setting to interact with Japanese exchange students and learn many fascinating facts about Japanese culture. Japanese students are also able to learn more about America from Kent State students and improve and grow their English skills along the way. Over my many years of involvement in this club, Iâ€™ve helped plan events, lead discussions, and provide assistance to all members of the club, especially to Japanese students who may feel uncomfortable in a new environment. Overall, my experience in this club has helped me improve in my social skills, learn more about Japanese culture, and gave me a valuable opportunity to develop and thrive as a leader in a unique environment.</p>
